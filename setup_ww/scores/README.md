The scores files are ordered as follows:
1. ```baseline_short_<>.json``` are the baseline algorithms' (in [Ray et al. 2019](https://cdn.openai.com/safexp-short.pdf)) results after training 1M environment steps for the ```PointGoal1```, ```PointGoal2``` and ```CarGoal1``` environments, and 2M steps for the rest of the environments.
2. ```baseline_long_<>.json``` are the baseline algorithms' results after performing the full training run (50M steps for ```DoggoGoal1``` and 10M for the rest).
